 Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
Chemlogic is a logic program for computer chemistry
\noun default
 that performs stoichiometric calculations, balances and completes equations,
 and converts between formulas and names.
 The program has applications in education, particularly as a study tool.
 Features are implemented using a chemical information database, linear
 equation solver, and grammatical rules.
 Guidance is provided for resolving errors in user input.
 Chemlogic is available on Android and the Web.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
In high school Chemistry
\noun default
, students learn to work with chemical compounds, equations and stoichiometric
 calculations.
 Algorithms were researched, adapted to chemistry problems and implemented
 in Prolog to develop the program, so that it could be useful to both students
 and teachers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Design and Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
User input is parsed
\noun default
 into a form that can be easily manipulated and transformed.
 A parser recognizes a formal grammar describing valid user input.
 In Prolog, parsers are implemented using DCGs (Definite Clause Grammars),
 which provide a simplified syntax for creating logical clauses that process
 a grammar using difference lists, an efficient representation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "triska:dcg"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Internal representations must be created for the parsed input.
 Chemlogic uses a pseudo-Abstract Syntax Tree to record the structure of
 an equation, as well as lists containing useful information (e.g.
 the elements contained in an equation).

\noun on
The reaction type analysis module
\noun default
 identifies common types of chemical reactions, predicts whether a reaction
 will take place, and completes chemical equations for common reactions,
 given the reactants.
 These features are implemented by matching the Abstract Syntax Tree generated
 by parsing an equation, against a pattern representing the structure of
 a certain chemical reaction type.
 In Prolog, this matching is performed by syntactic unification, which is
 the process of combining two structures by replacing variables with constant
 terms, so as to make the two structures equal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the reaction type is determined, a prediction can be made as to whether
 the reaction will occur by comparing the relative positions in the reactivity
 series of the elements involved.
 The reaction type and the reaction prediction can then be displayed by
 the user interfaces, as additional information for the entered chemical
 equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To complete a chemical equation, the complete formulas of the product compounds
 must be calculated, given the arrangements of elements and ions determined
 by reaction pattern.
 This process is performed using rules specific to the type of compound
 being formed by the reaction.
 The complete formulas are then substituted into the equation structure,
 to produce a complete chemical equation.
 This structure can then be used as input by other modules, such as the
 chemical equation balancer.

Balancing of chemical equations
\noun default
 is usually performed by inspection.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "sandner2008bc"

\end_inset

 This process cannot easily be used in a program because it is unsystematic.
 Instead, Chemlogic uses an efficient algorithm, representing a chemical
 equation as a system of linear equations.
 One linear equation is created for every element in a chemical equation,
 with the number of occurrences of the element in each formula representing
 a coefficient, multiplied by an unknown (the chemical equation coefficient).

\begin_layout Standard
These systems are commonly solved by converting them to a matrix and applying
 Gaussian elimination.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "eigenstate:chembalancerjs"

\end_inset

 In Chemlogic, a matrix is produced from structures created by the parser
 and lookup tables.
 The matrix is converted into a system of linear equations, which is then
 provided to the built-in CLP(q) facility, which can solve constraints over
 rational numbers.

\end_inset

Stoichiometry is an important new feature
\noun default
 of Chemlogic.
 The process of performing stoichiometric calculations begins by parsing
 a chemical equation that includes quantities for some compounds.
 Whenever a quantity is parsed, the number of significant figures in the
 value is determined and recorded in the quantity structure.
 A list of queries for quantities to be determined is also parsed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Abstract Syntax Tree for the given chemical equation is then traversed
 to determine the number of known quantities.
 If more than one quantity is known, the limiting reactant must be determined
 and used to calculate the results.
 This is performed by converting each known reactant quantity to moles (the
 standard unit for the amount of a chemical substance), then dividing by
 the corresponding coefficient of the reactant in the equation.
 The limiting reactant always has the lowest value for this ratio.
 If only one quantity is known, it must, logically, be used to perform all
 the calculations.

\noun on
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the correct quantity and compound to use
\noun on
 
\noun default
as input for the calculation is determined, the list of queries is traversed,
 and the input quantity is converted to each requested output quantity.
 This calculation is performed according to the same method that is typically
 used when performing stoichiometric calculations manually.
 Unit conversions are performed by simple calculation rules, which take
 into account the maximum number of significant figures that can be yielded
 by the calculation.

\end_inset

Syntax errors
\noun default
 cannot simply cause a program to fail --- clear identification and explanation
 of an error is necessary.
 When a predicate that must succeed for a given input to be valid fails,
 a syntax error exception is thrown, containing a code name for the error
 and the remaining unparsed input (within the tail).
 The exception handler attempts to localize the error by highlighting only
 the erroneous part of the tail, using rules specific to the type of the
 first character.

\end_inset

The Android App was developed
\noun default
 to make Chemlogic more readily available as a study tool.
 The App consists of a user-interface, implemented in Java, using the Android
 APIs, and a package consisting of the cross-compiled code of Chemlogic
 and its dependencies.
 The user interface communicates with Chemlogic through a UNIX pipe.
 Upon receiving the solution from Chemlogic, the interface renders the formattin
g of the result and displays it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Chemlogic package contains a copy of the Chemlogic command-line interface,
 compiled as a stand-alone application with an embedded Prolog interpreter
 in its binary, some necessary Linux libraries and an initialization script.
 When loaded, the App executes the initialization script, which starts Chemlogic
 by running the dynamic linker to locate and link Chemlogic with the provided
 libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
Prolog was chosen
\noun default
 as the language for Chemlogic because its features make it well suited
 to writing programs of this type in a simple and efficient way.
 The built-in Definite Clause Grammars syntax allows a programmer to implement
 advanced parsers using a very simple syntax, and strong support for metaprogram
ming allows syntax and code to be simplified in powerful ways.
 Using a logic programming language, such as Prolog, enables the programmer
 to describe the results, instead of the process.

Performance was analyzed
\noun default
 in Chemlogic by counting inferences (provided by 
\family typewriter
time/1
\family default
) used by different algorithms for various problem sizes.
 Algorithms were compared on their fixed inferences (intercept), inferences
 per item (slope) and to ensure that their complexities were not exponential.

Further research and development
\noun default
 --- The parsers currently implemented in Chemlogic process user input directly,
 as character lists, without a tokenization process.
 Using new features available in version 7 of SWI-Prolog, a simple and fast
 procedure could be implemented to separate user input into space-delimited
 parts, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "swi:doublequote"

\end_inset

 significantly reducing the number of tests and operations required to perform
 parsing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Developing a feature to automatically generate and mark random chemistry
 problems for student review and test creation, would be an important extension
 to Chemlogic.
 With the addition of reaction type analysis, the preliminary development
 for this feature has been completed.
 The reaction type, equation, formula and name grammars in Chemlogic could
 be extended to produce random valid structures, in addition to simply recognizi
ng and converting them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\noun on
Each module of Chemlogic
\noun default
 is designed to transform the standardized Abstract Syntax Trees generated
 by the parsers, allowing for modules to be composed together, each adding
 a piece of functionality as structures are passed from predicate to predicate.
 In this way, existing modules can make use of new functionality, new features
 can be implemented based on existing calculations and structures, and modules
 can be connected to as part of integrated user interfaces.

\noun on
Chemlogic was successfully extended
\noun default
 to implement new features, based upon the existing modular structure, and
 can now perform stoichiometric calculations, convert chemical quantities
 between units, and complete chemical reactions.
 The balancing and formula to name conversion features were further developed
 and made available in a mobile application for Android.

Earlier Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original version of Chemlogic was an experimental program I developed
 in 2012, to simplify my Science homework.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on these experiments, the project was extended in 2013 and 2014.
 The program was rewritten in Prolog, new algorithms were studied and adapted
 and many new features were implemented.
 The current modular design and structure of Chemlogic was implemented in
 Version 1, which supported balancing chemical equations, converting chemical
 names to formulas, and vice-versa.
 This version was presented at the 2014 CWSF in Windsor, where it received
 a Bronze Excellence Award.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2014 and 2015, Chemlogic was further developed to significantly expand
 the project, by continuing to improve existing features, adding a new user
 interface and adding support for higher levels of high school Chemistry.
 Version 2 of Chemlogic introduced the Android user interface and support
 for stoichiometric calculations, chemical unit conversions and reaction
 type analysis.
