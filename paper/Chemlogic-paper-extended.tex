\begin{abstract}
Chemlogic is a logic program for performing stoichiometric calculations,
converting chemical quantities between units, balancing and completing
chemical equations and converting chemical formulas to and from chemical
names. These features are implemented using a database of chemical
information, a set of grammars, and a linear equation solver. Chemlogic
can detect and provide guidance for resolving syntax and other errors.
It is available as an Android App (designed as a study tool for chemistry
students), a Web interface and a command-line domain-specific language.

\section{Design and Algorithms}

Chemlogic implements two major features: Balancing symbolic or word
equations and converting chemical names to formulas and vice versa.
These operations are done using two interesting algorithms, which
will be discussed below. 


\subsection{Balancing Chemical Equations with Systems of Linear Equations\label{sub:Balancing-Chemical}}


\subsubsection{Balancing by Inspection}

Chemical equations are most commonly balanced \textbf{by inspection}.
\cite{sandner2008bc}\textbf{ }In this process, a single element is
balanced over the entire equation. Then, more elements are balanced
and the resulting coefficients corrected until the entire equation
is balanced.\textbf{ }

\begin{algorithm}
\protect\caption{An example of balancing by inspection}


\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}+O_{2}} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{CO_{2}+H_{2}O}\label{eq:ethane-unbal}\\
\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}+O_{2}} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{CO_{2}+3H_{2}O}\label{eq:ethane-h}\\
\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}+O_{2}} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{2CO_{2}+3H_{2}O}\label{eq:ethane-c}\\
\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}+\nicefrac{7}{2}O_{2}} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{2CO_{2}+3H_{2}O}\label{eq:ethane-o}\\
2\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}+7O_{2}} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{4CO_{2}+6H_{2}O}\label{eq:ethane-bal}
\end{eqnarray}


(\ref{eq:ethane-unbal}) The combustion of ethane, (\ref{eq:ethane-h})
There are 6 hydrogens on the left-hand side, so there must be 6 on
the right (3 groups of 2), (\ref{eq:ethane-c}) There are 2 carbons
on the left, so there must be 2 on the right, (\ref{eq:ethane-o})
Now there are 7 oxygens on the right (2 groups of 2 = 4 from $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$
and 3 from $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$), but oxygens come only in groups of
2, \ref{eq:ethane-bal}Each coefficient must be multiplied by 2 to
clear the fraction.
\end{algorithm}
This process is not very useful for implementing a program because
it is not systematic: steps may be performed differently or in different
orders, depending on the equation to be balanced. Even a certain equation,
such as the example could be balanced in a different way.


\subsubsection{Balancing by Trial and Error\label{sub:Balancing-by-Trial}}

Another unsystematic process is to randomly select coefficients until
the equation is balanced. This process is also unsystematic, but easy
to programatically implement. The complexity of such a method increases
exponentially; for an equation with 4 terms and a maximum coefficient
of 10, balancing the equation may take, at worst, \textbf{$10^{4}=10,000$
}guesses.

If we expect that equations will generally have few terms and low
coefficients, the massive processing power of modern computers will
likely make the inefficiency of such a method unnoticeable to user.
In fact, this method may even perform better on small problems than
more complex solvers, with fixed costs to create tables and costs
per equation evaluated.

Besides the likelihood of the program never terminating when faced
with a complex equation, this method is also unsatisfying because
it is simply an application of brute-force, instead of finding a logical
solution.


\subsubsection{Balancing using Systems of Linear Equations}

An elegantly logical method is to convert a chemical equation into
a system of linear equations \cite{tuckerman:nyu}, with one equation
representing each element, the number of each element representing
a coefficient to an unknown variable, representing the chemical equation
coefficient for a substance. To make the system solvable, the first
unknown is arbitrarily set to 1.

\begin{algorithm}
\protect\caption{The representation of a chemical equation as a system of linear equations}


\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{H_{2}+O_{2}} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{H_{2}O}\label{eq:lin-ex-eq}\\
a\mathrm{H_{2}+\mathit{b}O_{2}} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{\mathit{c}H_{2}O}\label{eq:lin-ex-vars}\\
\begin{cases}
2a & =2c\\
2b & =c\\
a & =1
\end{cases}\label{eq:lin-ex-sys}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{algorithm}


The resulting values can then be multiplied by the greatest common
denominator of the values to remove any fractions.\\
\\
The process of converting a chemical equation to a system of linear
equations, which is performed by a parser, can be made even simpler
to implement by creating equations that are all in the same form (\ref{eq:lin-sys-sys})
or by creating a matrix \cite{eigenstate:chembalancerjs} (\ref{eq:lin-sys-matrix}):

\begin{algorithm}
\protect\caption{Systematic representation of chemical equation (\ref{eq:lin-ex-eq})}


\begin{align}
 & \begin{cases}
2a+0b-2c & =0\\
0a+2b-1c & =0\\
a & =1
\end{cases}\label{eq:lin-sys-sys}\\
 & \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc|c}
2 & 0 & -2 & 0\\
0 & 2 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right\} \label{eq:lin-sys-matrix}
\end{align}
\end{algorithm}



\subsubsection{Methods of Solving Systems of Linear Equations\label{sub:Methods-of-Solving}}

When a system of linear equations is converted into a matrix, it can
be solved by performing Gaussian elimination on the matrix. \cite{eigenstate:chembalancerjs}
The unknowns can then be found from the matrix.\\
\\
The parser in Chemlogic produces a structure that is then simply transformed
into a matrix, but it is not solved directly, but is converted into
a system of linear equations, to take advantage of the built-in linear
equation solver (CLP(q)) provided by SWI-Prolog. 

This allows for provided code to be re-used and makes programming
simpler, at the cost of inefficient conversions between forms.


\subsection{Using DCGs to Parse Chemical Names, Formulas and Equations\label{sub:Using-DCGs}}


\subsubsection{About DCGs}

In any program that deals with user input, the input must be converted
into a form that can be processed and interpreted. This process is
called parsing.

A parser recognizes a formal grammar and can produce structures that
can be manipulated programmatically from information contained in
the inputs. The parsing facility provided in many logic programming
languages, including Prolog, is an implementation of DCGs (Definite
Clause Grammars).\cite{triska:dcg} This type of grammar maps a grammatical
rule to a logic programming clause. They can be simply described as
a simplified syntax for creating functions that process a grammar
using lists.

In Prolog, DCGs are implemented using difference lists, an extremely
efficient representation that has many useful properties. 

\begin{figure}
\protect\caption{A very simple grammar (binary ionic compounds)\label{fig:simple-grammar}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
compound --> metal, " ",non_metal_base, ide.

metal --> "sodium".
metal --> "calcium".
metal --> "silver".

non_metal_base --> "chlor".
non_metal_base --> "ox".
non_metal_base --> "sulf".

ide --> "ide".
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}
Chemlogic uses grammatical rules to describe valid chemical names,
formulas and equations. A simple example is shown in Figure\vref{fig:simple-grammar}.


\subsubsection{Difference Lists and the Implementation of DCGs}

Many programming languages have their own definition for a list. In
Prolog, a list is a structure consisting of an arbitrary number of
elements. Elements can be of any valid Prolog data type, most relevantly
an atom (a single unit of characters) and nested sub-lists.

Difference lists consist of an instantiated part, the head and an
uninstantiated part, the tail. The tail is always paired with the
rest of the list. This can be a difficult concept to understand and
the major use of difference lists is in DCGs, where it is not exposed
to the programmer. See Figure\vref{fig:internal-grammar} for an example
of difference list usage.

\begin{figure}
\protect\caption{The internal form of the grammar from Figure \ref{fig:simple-grammar}
\label{fig:internal-grammar}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
compound(Compound, Rest) :-
	metal(Compound, MetalRest),
    MetalRest=[' '|SpaceRest],
	non_metal_base(SpaceRest, NonMetalRest),
	ide(NonMetalRest, Rest).

metal([s, o, d, i, u, m|Rest], Rest).
non_metal_base([c, h, l, o, r|Rest], Rest).
ide([i, d, e|Rest], Rest).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}


In DCG clauses, the head is matched with the the input and any remaining
data is returned as the tail, which is passed to the next clause,
which performs the same matching until the entire input is parsed
and the remaining tail is given back to the user (or rejected as a
syntax error in Chemlogic). If any clause fails, Prolog will backtrack
to find another clause that can satisfy the grammar. If none is found,
then the parsing fails. To better explain the function of difference
lists in practice, a sample parsing is shown in Figure\vref{fig:trace-grammar}.

\begin{figure}
\protect\caption{An simplified trace of the grammar in Figure \ref{fig:simple-grammar}\label{fig:trace-grammar}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
[trace]  ?- compound("sodium chloride",Rest).
	metal("sodium chloride", MetalRest)
metal("sodium chloride", " chloride")

 	non_metal_base("chloride", NonMetalRest)
non_metal_base("chloride", "ide")
	ide("ide", IdeRest)
ide("ide", [])
compound("sodium chloride", [])

yes.
\end{lstlisting}


1. Parse \texttt{``sodium chloride''} as a compound.

2. Parse \texttt{``sodium chloride''} as a metal leaving \texttt{MetalRest}.

3. \texttt{``sodium''} is consumed (the head), leaving \texttt{``
chloride''} (the tail).

---

5. Parse \texttt{``chloride''} as a non-metal base name leaving
\texttt{NonMetalRest}.

6. \texttt{``chlor''} is consumed (the head), leaving \texttt{``ide''}
(the tail).

7. Parse \texttt{``ide''} as an \texttt{ide} terminal.

8. \texttt{``ide''} is consumed (the head), leaving the empty list,
\texttt{{[}{]}} (the tail).

9. Therefore, \texttt{``sodium chloride''} is a compound with no
remaining characters.

10. The result of the parsing.
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Extra Arguments\label{sub:Extra-Arguments}}

The parsers that have been described so far can only state whether
or not a given input conforms to a grammar or not (in Figure\vref{fig:trace-grammar}
the answer was ``\texttt{yes}'' --- it is valid). In order to make
a program actually perform any tasks, some information must be recorded
about the input that is parsed (Figure\vref{fig:extra-grammar}).
This information is then in an internal representation which can be
manipulated by the other parts of the program. Commonly, the internal
representation is an Abstract Syntax Tree (implemented in Prolog using
terms), but in Chemlogic a simple list is used. The AST provides the
advantage of the various components of the input being labeled (e.g.
\texttt{(metal(Na), non\_metal(Cl))}), but lists are easier to manipulate.

\begin{figure}
\protect\caption{A new version of the parser from Figure \ref{fig:simple-grammar},
using extra arguments and its result\label{fig:extra-grammar}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
compound([Metal,...,NonMetal,...]) --> metal(Metal), " ",
non_metal_base(NonMetal), ide.

metal("Na") --> "sodium".
metal("Ca") --> "calcium".
metal("Ag") --> "silver".

non_metal_base("Cl") --> "chlor".
non_metal_base("O") --> "ox".
non_metal_base("S") --> "sulf".

ide --> "ide".
\end{lstlisting}


1. Extra arguments are passed to the parsing rules. The arguments
are assembled into a list.

---

3---5. Values are provided for these arguments (the element symbol).

---

7---9. Values are also provided by this predicate.

---

11. This predicate does not record any information.

~

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
?- compound(Compound,"sodium chloride",Rest).
	Compound = [['N', a], ..., ['C', l], ...], 
	Rest = [] .
\end{lstlisting}


1. A new argument is added to the beginning of the query: the \texttt{Compound}
structure.

2. The structure created for \texttt{``sodium chloride''} is \texttt{{[}Na,...,Cl,...{]}}.

3. There is nothing remaining after parsing --- the input conforms
to the grammar.
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Semicontext Notation}

Another difficult concepts in DCGs is semicontext notation. It allows
elements not originally present in the input being processed to be
added to the parsing list. After the grammar rule is parsed, the pushback
list is added to the front of the parsing list (see Figure\vref{fig:semicontext-grammar}).

Semicontext notation can be used to implement lookahead, where a parser
checks the next element in a list without processing it. This is used
to make decisions about how to parse a certain element based on elements
that occur after it. A lookahead is implemented by removing the item
to be tested, testing it, then using the pushback list to put it back
on the list of tokens to be parsed. Decisions can then be made based
on the results of the test. 

Figure\vref{fig:lookahead-grammar} demonstrates the use of a simple
lookahead.

\begin{figure}


\protect\caption{A trivial example and usage of semicontext notation\label{fig:semicontext-grammar}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
censor, 
	"secret metal" 
	--> "sodium".
\end{lstlisting}


1. Define a rule called \texttt{censor}.

2. Push \texttt{``secret metal''} to the front of the list, if...

3. \texttt{``sodium''} is parsed.

~

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
?- censor("sodium",Rest). 
	Rest = "secret metal".
\end{lstlisting}


1. Call our completely useless predicate.

2. Notice that it did not parse anything --- it just made \texttt{``secret
metal''} the remaining unparsed list.

This predicate could perhaps be connected to another rule that processes
compounds --- it will receive the censored version.
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}


\protect\caption{A simple example and usage of a lookahead implemented with semicontext
notation\label{fig:lookahead-grammar}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
is_vowel_drop, 
	[Tested] 
	--> [Tested], 
	{Tested = 'a'; Tested = 'o'}.
\end{lstlisting}


1. Define a rule called \texttt{is\_vowel\_drop}.

2. Push the content of \texttt{Tested} to the front of the list, if...

3. \texttt{Tested} is removed from the list, and...

4. \texttt{Tested} is \texttt{a} or \texttt{o}.

~

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
?- is_vowel_drop("oxygen",NonMetal). 
NonMetal = [o, x, y, g, e, n].

?- is_vowel_drop("chlorine",NonMetal). 
false. 
\end{lstlisting}


1. Should we drop the vowel from our prefix if the non metal is oxygen?

2. Yes! Notice that \texttt{``oxygen''} has been left untampered
and can be parsed by a non-metal rule.

---

4. Should we drop the vowel from our prefix if the non metal is chlorine?

5. No! Our rule will fail and a clause that doesn't drop the vowel
will try to process this compound.
\end{figure}



\section{Implementation}


\subsection{Notes for the Equation Balancer}


\subsubsection{Building the Matrix}

The equation balancer implements the linear equation balancing algorithm
described in \vref{sub:Balancing-Chemical} in multiple processes.

First, the parser is configured to produce structures (as described
in \vref{sub:Using-DCGs}) containing the formulas involved in an
equation, the elements involved in an equation and a structure grouping
the formulas into reactants and products (equation structure). 

The element structure is sorted and duplicates are removed to produce
an element set.

Then, the equation structure is tabulated: a lookup table is produced
which records the number of occurrences of an element in a given formula.
Polyatomic groups are flattened by this process (their subscript is
distributed to their elements and the elements are added by the same
process as is used when they are on their own).%
\footnote{For example: $\mathrm{NH_{4}NO_{3}}$ is flattened to \texttt{{[}N2,
H4, O3{]}}%
}. The process of creating a lookup table is commonly used in chemical
equation balancers --- see \cite{eigenstate:chembalancerjs} for a
balancer that uses a roughly similar procedure.

To finally construct the matrix, each element is evaluated and its
count in each formula is recorded.


\subsubsection{Solving the Equations}

To use Prolog's built-in equation solver, the matrix is converted
back into an equation, a process made simple by Prolog's ability to
treat code as data (metaprogramming, \vref{sub:Metaprogramming}).

The solver used in Chemlogic is CLP(q) (Constraint Logic Programming
over Rational Numbers)\cite{holzbaur:clpq}, which is built-in to
SWI-Prolog. This solver is used since the coefficients of a chemical
equation are always rational numbers, but may sometimes not be integers
before the fractions are cleared.%
\footnote{A more common solver, built-in to nearly all Prolog systems, CLPfd
(Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains) had annoying limitations
regarding this situation.%
}

CLP(q) allows input of equations in a simple notation and provides
the solution to the unknowns by instantiating Prolog variables used
in the equations. The results are always reduced to lowest terms using
the provided predicate \texttt{bb\_inf}.


\subsubsection{Providing Results to the User}

The solved coefficients are re-inserted into the structures, which
are then provided as results to a parser. The parser returns the input
that would create those structures (i.e. human-readable equations).

The program could be made more efficient by not re-parsing the structures
to provide output, instead inserting the coefficients directly into
the human-readable input by some method.


\subsection{Notes for the Formula and Name Processing Code}


\subsubsection{Validation}

Chemlogic uses a formula parser to convert formulas inputted by users
to their internal representation in Chemlogic. The formulas are verified
to ensure that they are in the correct form, but whether or not they
represent valid compounds is not verified, to support balancing equations
with types of compounds that are not known to the program. When parsing
a name or converting a formula to a name, the input is checked to
ensure that the compounds conform to the types known by Chemlogic.


\subsubsection{DCG Translation}

The chemical information database is not used directly. Instead, a
file called \texttt{fact\_dcg\_translate} converts the facts to grammatical
rules, providing base names, formulas, full names, symbols, etc. in
whatever output format is selected (see \vref{sub:Output-Formatting}
for a brief discussion of output formats).

This process is cached when Chemlogic is compiled, so it is only re-run
when the database is changed.


\subsubsection{Element Structure}

In order to create the element structures used by the balancer, the
formula and name parsers record the elements contained in the input
in a flat structure created by using additional difference lists as
extra arguments to the DCG (see \vref{sub:Extra-Arguments} for a
discussion of extra arguments).


\subsection{Handling User Syntax and other Errors}


\subsubsection{About Error Handling in Chemlogic}

The features and algorithms discussed so far deal only with cases
when user input conforms to the grammars. If the user makes a mistake,
the only information he is given is ``\texttt{false.}''

In order to make Chemlogic truly useful, it must identify where in
the input the problem has occurred and provide clear error guidance.

Clearly identifying a syntax error is a difficult problem: even many
programming languages cannot provide clear guidance as to what is
wrong. Implementing error handling took nearly as long as writing
the rest of Chemlogic and the process of implementation uncovered
a few bugs and poor design decisions in the parsers.


\subsubsection{Raising a Syntax Error}

Whenever a predicate that must succeed for a given input to be valid
fails, a syntax error is raised. The error term contains a code name
for the error that will be used to look up messages and the list of
unparsed tokens remaining that can no longer be parsed because of
this error. In Prolog, this is done by \texttt{throw}ing an exception.
Exceptions stop the execution of the program and backtrack through
the program until a handler can be found --- the \texttt{catch}er. 

The actual process of raising the syntax error is simplified with
the \texttt{xx} operator (see \vref{sub:Metaprogramming}).


\subsubsection{Explaining the Syntax Error}

The exception is then given to the error explaining library. It first
attempts to localize the error by searching for the problematic part
in the unparsed tokens. It does this by testing the character type
of the first character, then implementing rules depending on the type
(e.g. if the first character is a letter, read until a number or capital
letter is reached, etc.) The erroneous part is recorded.

Messages are then looked up using the error code and the character
type. Knowing what type of character has triggered the error can often
pinpoint the problem and allow for different messages to be used when
a logic error is suspected (e.g. bad letters in a compound name) or
when a simple typing error is suspected (e.g. unusual symbols like
\textasciicircum{} in a compound name).

A structure is created from the information determined by the error
explainer. It is then re-thrown --- the exception is allowed to pass
all the way back to the predicate that called the parser. The calling
predicate is an interface function (from either the command-line or
the web interface). Using metaprogramming techniques, the exception
is then given to a handler that knows how to render the error in that
interface (e.g. \texttt{cli\_error} knows how to highlight the erroneous
part using ANSI color).


\subsection{Simplification of Program Code using Metaprogramming\label{sub:Metaprogramming}}

Many functional and logical programming languages, including Prolog
have strong support for metaprogramming. Metaprogramming allows a
program to write or manipulate parts of itself (or other programs).
\cite{wiki:metaprogramming}

In the Fact---DCG translator (Figure\vref{fig:code-as-data}), data
is extracted from a fact and is then reassembled into a new term,
which is asserted as a grammatical rule. This ability to manipulate
code as data is a very useful feature. In this case, using metaprogramming
saves the database builder from manually entering data in these awkward
forms.

\begin{figure}[h]
\protect\caption{\texttt{fact\_dcg\_translate.pl} converting a group fact into a lot
of rules\label{fig:code-as-data}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
cl_poly_to_dcg(group([["N",1],["H",4]],"ammonium","n/a")) :-
	Clause =.. [_Functor,Sym,Name,Base], 

	dcg_translate_rule(group(ElemsL,ElemsR,Sym,Name) --> Name,FullRule),
	assertz(FullRule),

	dcg_translate_rule(group_base(ElemsL,ElemsR,Sym,Base) --> Base,BaseRule),
	assertz(BaseRule),
\end{lstlisting}
1. An input clause (code)

2. The clause (code) is separated into data

---

4. A new clause (code) is translated from the data

5. The new code is loaded into the program
\end{figure}
Chemlogic also makes use of the ability to call an arbitrary predicate
at runtime (a common programming language feature) to avoid writing
many different variants of the same predicate (Figure\vref{fig:runtime-call}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\protect\caption{covalent.pl using call to implement multiple variants of the same
code\label{fig:runtime-call}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]
systematic_covalent([[Sym1,Num1],[Sym2,Num2]]) -->
	covalent_part(nonmetal,Sym1,sub_first,Num1), !,
	" ",
	covalent_part(nonmetal_ide,Sym2,sub_general,Num2) xx covalent_part_2.

covalent_part(SymGoal,Sym,NumGoal,Num) -->  	
	{fwd_flag(Num,Hack)},  	
	call(NumGoal,Num,Letter),  	
	call(SymGoal,Sym,Matched,_),  	
	( 		
		{double_vowel_test(Letter,Matched)};  		
		fwd_stop(Hack,vowel_required) 	
	).
\end{lstlisting}


---

2. Call a predicate telling it to use non-metal (without ide ending)
and prefixes for the first element in a compound.

---

4. The same predicate now instructed to use non-metal with ide ending
and to use normal prefix rules

---

7. Doing some processing. These lines of code don't have to be written
n times.

8 and 9. Call the predicates instructed

10---13. Perform operations on the results of the predicates.
\end{figure}
The most interesting use of metaprogramming is the ability to define
new operators that extend the programming language with a simple syntax
for a repetitive task. 

In Chemlogic, two operators are defined: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{xx}, the syntax error operator: it executes the predicate
on its left-hand side and, if it fails, raises the given syntax error
on its right-hand side. It is used in parsers to stop whenever a grammatical
rule fails. (See Figure\vref{fig:xx-operator}).
\item \texttt{handle}, the error operator: it executes the predicate on
its left-hand side and, if a syntax error occurs it calls correct
handler function for the interface, then returns the result on its
right-hand side. It is used in interface code to show the correct
error message
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h]

There are many potential places where more metaprogramming could be
added to Chemlogic: the various extra arguments used in the DCGs could
be simplified with special operators and a goal/term expansion function.
This would massively simplify the parsers. Also, the Web interface
has some code that performs the same steps, but with different predicates.
These could be combined with the use of runtime calls.


\section{Interfaces and Miscellaneous Code}


\subsection{Android Application --- A new user interface}


\subsubsection{Summary}

The Chemlogic App for Android was developed to allow users to use
the program on a mobile device. Due to the popularity of mobile devices
and the convience of mobile applications, this improvement greatly
increases the number of users who would use the program and enables
students to easily use Chemlogic as a study tool for chemistry classes. 

The existing code of Chemlogic, written in Prolog, was cross-compiled
for the processors used in Android devices and is used unmodified,
simplifying the development of new features.

The App consists of a user-interface, implemented in Java, using the
Android APIs, and a system package consisting of the cross-compiled
Chemlogic code, and its dependencies.


\subsubsection{The Implementation of the User Interface and the System Package}

The user interface renders the design of the app (textboxes, buttons,
etc.), verifies the input to ensure that it does not contain invalid
Prolog syntax and then communicates with Chemlogic through a UNIX
pipe. Upon receiving the response, it renders the formatting of the
result (e.g. subscripts, arrows and colored error messages) and displays
it. The user interface also adds an extra row of keys to the keyboard
which contains symbols commonly used in chemical equations and formulas.

The system package, which is approximately 4 MB in size, contains
a copy of Chemlogic, compiled as a stand-alone application (meaning
that it includes the Prolog interpreter in its binary), some required
Linux libraries and an initialization script. When loaded, the App
interface executes the initialization script, which starts Chemlogic
by running the dynamic linker to locate and link Chemlogic with the
provided libraries and then executes it. The cross-compilation process
required to build the system package is extremely complicated, so
it has been automated to reduce developer work and eliminate errors.
Because the Android platform does not install the assets provided
with the App, a procedure was implemented that verifies whether latest
version of the system package is present and will extract the files
and install them, if necessary.

Once Chemlogic is installed and started, the user interface writes
a command to the pipe, when Chemlogic reads. Chemlogic writes its
answer to the pipe, which the interface reads. This method could be
replaced with bindings between Prolog and Java, which would simplify
the development of the App, but would increase the complexity of the
cross-compilation process.


\subsubsection{Interprocess Communication in the App }

The pipe model is, however, one of the most interesting parts of the
UNIX model: everything is a file, everything is text, anything can
read text and anything can write text. It allows many utilities to
be connected to each other, each reading the previous one's output
and writing to the next one. User input/output is, in fact, implemented
using this model as well: the keyboard is piped to the input and the
output is piped to the screen. This method of interprocess communication
raises an interesting dilemma: How do the interface and Chemlogic
know when the other end of the pipe finishes transmitting data (like
a query or a response)? 

Unlike a subroutine which automatically returns a variable to its
caller, the two programs must be explicitly instructed to look for
a specific pattern in order to know when to proceed. 

When a user interacts with a command-line program, patterns are recognized
by both the human user and the program itself: When the user enters
a command, he presses ENTER. Now the system sees that the user has
finished typing and it processes the input and displays its response.
When the interactive prompt is displayed, the user sees that the system
is ready to receive another query. The user interface and the Android
App use these patterns, as well, allowing existing code to be used
with minor modifications.

It must be noted that although the pipe model would seem to imply
transmission and communication between computers (and often can),
in this case the communication is entirely virtual --- it is between
multiple processes on the same computer. The mechanism is almost exactly
the same from the point of view of the two programs that are communicating
over the pipe.


\subsection{Web Interface --- A user-friendly way of using the program}


\subsubsection{Advantages of Web Interfaces}

Command-line interfaces are often not user-friendly. Terminals also
cannot display subscripts and special characters, making the output
an approximation of the correct form of an equation or formula. 

A web interface can provide a graphical interface to a program, making
it simple to use select features and options, that is also available
over the network.%
\footnote{This allows an entire computer lab to use a single copy of Chemlogic
installed on a server, for example.

If a copy of the \texttt{chemweb} (the web interface is running),
users can access it by going to:

\url{http://<ip-address>:8000/chemlogic/}%
}


\subsubsection{SWI-Prolog's Web stack}

SWI-Prolog has a built-in Web stack, \cite{wielemaker:tplp2008} providing
a server that can run Prolog programs and send their output over HTTP.
To avoid writing HTML manually and handling arguments, SWI-Prolog
provides an excellent library that allows HTML to be written as Prolog
terms and input to be validated. To keep code organized, a library
that can insert menus, stylesheets and other header elements. These
features make writing Web applications in Prolog even simpler than
in many common languages used in Web programming.

The web libraries make excellent use of DCGs and metaprogramming in
their implementations, making code easy to understand.


\subsubsection{Output Formatting\label{sub:Output-Formatting}}

In order to produce the correct formatting codes for each interface
(HTML entities in this case), the handling of symbols is decoupled
from the various parsers and is instead implemented in a common formatting
library. This allows for readable and correct formatting in the Web
interface.


\subsection{Command-line Interface --- An extremely simple DSL\label{sub:Command-line-Interface}}

During the development of Chemlogic, it was often necessary to run
various predicates in order to test the program. Calling Prolog predicates,
as is, is not a user-friendly command-line interface, however. It
requires the user to enter his query as a Prolog statement and gives
back the answer as a list of characters.

Using metaprogramming techniques, like defining operators, calling
at runtime and syntactic unification, it possible to build a very
simple DSL (domain specific language) for querying Chemlogic (see
Figure\vref{fig:dsl}). Despite the fact that it only implements 4
simple features, with 2 rules, language statements can be composed
into more complex programs. Prolog statements can also be used in
the DSL and language statements can be combined with Prolog statements
seamlessly.

The DSL offers an elegant way of balancing chemical equations and
converting formulas to names and vice versa by offering a simplified
syntax and automatic conversions to and from Prolog strings (see Figure\vref{fig:dsl-usage}).

Because of its simplicity, the DSL is mostly a proof of concept and
more syntax will need to be added (and the features to expose from
Chemlogic) to make writing it possible to write interesting programs
in this language.

\begin{figure}
\protect\caption{The entire code of the \texttt{chemcli} DSL \label{fig:dsl}}


\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily},breaklines=true,numbers=left]

	atom_chars(AtomInput,Input),
	(
		InputType = name -> name_2_formula(Input,StringRes) handle _;
		InputType = formula -> formula_2_name(Input,StringRes) handle _;
		balance_equation(InputType,Input,ResultType,StringRes) handle _ 
	), 	
	atom_chars(Result,StringRes).
\end{lstlisting}


A programming language in 13 lines of code.

\end{figure}



\section{Discussion}


\subsection{Suitability of Prolog for application}

Initially, Prolog was chosen because of its simple fact database and
built-in support for parsers as DCGs and for linear equation solvers.
Using a logic programming language would also reduce programmer work
by describing the results, not the process and by offering metaprogramming
features.

In practice, the simple fact database was no more convenient than
in any other programming language because the facts (the chemical
information database) had to be converted to DCG rules by a translator
in order for them to be used efficiently and correctly in parsers.

DCG support in Prolog and similar languages makes it possible to easily
write parser for all sorts of grammars. In most programming languages,
the programmer must write the parser from scratch or use a contributed
library. Chemlogic ended up using many advanced features of DCGs,
including extra arguments for constructing parsing structures, using
the underlying difference list representation for certain structures
and using semicontext notation for some simple lookahead rules.

In some places, parsing rules have become complicated and hacky, but
overall DCGs have made it simpler and more logical to construct grammars
and extend them for many types of data a chemistry program uses.\\
\\
As discussed in the section on the linear equation balancing algorithm
(\vref{sub:Methods-of-Solving}), using Prolog's linear equation solver
entails producing a system of linear equations, which is probably
re-converted to a matrix in order to be solved. Using the library
certainly simplified the code, because matrix operations are difficult
in many Programming languages and because implementing Gaussian elimination
requires a lot of mathematical understanding.\\
\\
Using a logic programming language made the code simpler and more
elegant. While the idea of describing results instead of process is
somewhat exaggerated, programming in Prolog avoids manual writing
of loops, if statements and other imperative constructs. It can be
rather amazing, when a situation can finally explained in Prolog,
how few lines of code are necessary to do something. %
\footnote{Perhaps this is why Prolog programmers name their variables A, X,
Acc, H, T, R0, etc and do not document things in detail?%
}\\
Metaprogramming was not used heavily but it proved to make code simpler
by allowing predicates to be generated from other predicates, by allowing
predicates that call other predicates and by defining convenient operators.
This last aspect proved to be the most interesting and was used as
the basis of the extremely simple \texttt{chemcli} DSL (\vref{sub:Command-line-Interface}).
The support of metaprogramming is more extensive in Prolog than in
many languages and it was relatively simple to make use of this support.


\subsection{Methods of Analyzing Performance in Prolog\label{sub:Methods-of-Analyzing}}

SWI-Prolog, like many programming language implementations, offers
a few tools for analyzing a program's performance. It includes \texttt{gxprof}
(A graphical profiler), \texttt{time} (a command-line predicate offering
a few simple statistics) and \texttt{statistics} (a command-line predicate
offering very detailed runtime statistics).

\texttt{gxprof} primarily performs time efficiency analyses, which
were often not useful for Chemlogic because the time taken by different
implementations were often so small as to be incomparable. Therefore
it was not used during the development of Chemlogic.

The most commonly used analysis function was \texttt{time}, which
provides a few interesting statistics, including inferences and Lips
(logical inferences per second?). I am unsure of exactly what the
inference count measures or its connection to the actual performance
of the algorithm. Inferences were a useful way of comparing algorithms
and implementations because it gave consistent results between runs
and on different computers.

Analysis was performed mostly by recording the performance of an predicate
for arguments of various sizes to try to find the fixed costs (intercept)
and cost per element (slope) and to ensure that there were no algorithms
with exponential cost. Inefficient pieces of code were found using
the debugger and new solutions were compared against old ones.

\texttt{statistics} may provide details that could be useful for future
research, but on a small program like Chemlogic analyzing some of
these statistics may be overly complicated.\\
\\
It must be noted that the performance of algorithms was not formally
analyzed (by creating mathematical definitions and determining the
fastest growing terms to find the worst-case performance, for example)
primarily because no novel algorithms were introduced in this program,
nor unusual adaptations.

Formal analysis of a specific parser may enable useful improvements
to be made.


\subsection{Organization and Structure of Code}

The organization of code is quite clear overall. I have tried to follow
proper naming, indention and structuring practices. Prolog allows
for code to be separated into modules with private predicates used
only inside a single module and public predicates that are useful
to other modules. Modules were frequently used to organize Chemlogic.


\subsubsection{Modularity of Interfaces and Error Handlers}

Since Chemlogic needed to support a Web interface to its Prolog predicates
which were used from the command-line, it was very important to allow
for the de-coupling of formatting and interfaces from the code itself.
The interfaces for Chemlogic often implement the bare-minimum required
to make the program modular, but there are a few over-engineered parts
that may prove useful when improving the detail of error messages.

The error handling system itself was an experiment, using Prolog exceptions,
handlers and meta-predicates that call modules. The design of the
error handling system is modular and relatively organized, but more
experience with Prolog exceptions may allow for improvements to the
design.


\subsubsection{Some Confusing Points}

There are few confusing interactions between pieces of code, with
a few small cases between the ionic, oxyanion and acid functions.
The lack of a tokenizer proved to make implementing error handling
problematic in some places, as it was always necessary to determine
whether or not a certain parser can safely give error messages or
whether it must simply fail and give the next parser a chance to process
the input. A tokenizer can quickly determine which parser to use and
avoid problems like these.

Some inefficient tokenizers are used to highlight the erroneous component
of user input. Since they are used only when a problem occurs, they
are not much of a concern.

The only uses of semicontext notation in this program were some hacks
to allow naming for pure substances to avoid triggering error messages.
This is a good place to target for improvement if a tokenizer is introduced.\\



\subsubsection{A Note about Covalent Prefixes}

Correctly handling the rule that the last vowel (if a or o) of an
IUPAC prefix is dropped if the succeeding element starts with an a
or o was quite difficult to implement. Figure\vref{fig:vowel-dropping}
shows some examples of the rule. 

It seems to me that this is a case of a Context-Sensitive Grammar,
where a certain token may or may not be permitted at a certain point
given its preceding token.

Currently a repeated test and a metaprogramming call is used to determine
the right prefix to use.

\begin{figure}
\protect\caption{Examples of vowel dropping in IUPAC prefixes\label{fig:vowel-dropping}}


\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
Prefix & Element & Result\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
mono & oxygen & \textbf{mon}oxygen\tabularnewline
\hline 
mono & carbon & \textbf{mono}carbon\tabularnewline
\hline 
tetra & oxygen & \textbf{tetr}oxygen\tabularnewline
\hline 
tri & iodine & \textbf{tri}iodine\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Tokenizers: Simpler and More Performant Code}

Very recently, SWI-Prolog introduced a new string type. \cite{swi:doublequote}
The string type solves many problems that have traditionally required
complicated workarounds in Prolog.

The type replaces the use of atoms for manipulated strings, or lists
of character codes with a more efficient data structure. The most
important (for Chemlogic) change is the introduction of a predicate
(split\_string/4) which allows for a string to be broken into parts
delimited by a character and allows extraneous padding characters
to be removed. The string type can still be operated on as a list
of character codes when needed (as in DCGs).\\
\\
The benefits to a program like Chemlogic from this change are quite
large: it is now simple to implement a tokenization step for the various
parsers, like most compilers and interpreters (You will recall that
Chemlogic does not tokenize its strings before parsing them).

Currently, when processing a string like ``carbon monoxide'', the
program must go through many testing steps (is it an ionic compound,
is carbon a metal, is it an acid, is carbon a polyatomic ion, and
their many sub-tests etc.) But, if the string is tokenized into {[}``carbon'',''monoxide''{]},
it is obvious it is not an ionic compound, because the first token
is not a metal and its obvious that it is not an acid because the
second part is not ``acid''.

In the case of determining if it is an acid, tokenization makes implementing
a lookahead parser simpler: one element lookahead instead of $n$
character lookahead (because it is not yet known how long the first
part of a string is in that case).\\
\\
The tokenizers currently in use for error parsing may be able to be
re-written in a simpler way using the new string type.


\subsection{Ideas for Additional Features}

Many ideas for new features are discussed from a programmatical perspective
in the \texttt{TODO} file distributed with the program and as an appendix
to this paper (Appendix\vref{sec:TODO}). Some of them are summarized
here:

In order to handle more complex types of organic compounds, the program
must be greatly extended to support manipulating structural formulas
(when given a name as input), displaying diagrams of them and to support
an input method for structural formulas. Since balancing and many
other parts of the program operate using molecular or empirical formulas,
a module can be written to ``flatten'' structural formulas, allowing
for code to be re-used.


\subsection{Further Research}


\subsubsection{Algorithms}

As discussed in \vref{sub:Balancing-by-Trial} (Balancing by Trial
and Error), the performance of the trial and error algorithm may be
better than the system of linear equations algorithm for simple cases.
It would be interesting to compare the algorithms using the inference
testing method described in \vref{sub:Methods-of-Analyzing}. The
performance of this algorithm will depend on the efficiency of a test
for whether the equation is balanced or not. The ranges of complexity
in which each algorithm performs better and the appropriate algorithm
selected for a specific balancing.

If Chemlogic is re-implemented, with an initial tokenization step,
the performance of the program (both using inference testing and wall-time
measurements, if possible. %
\footnote{Currently the individual algorithms in Chemlogic do not take more
than $\unit[0.005]{s}$ to run. The new algorithm may perform in similar
time, or the time may be affected by other factors.%
}) before and after the change can be compared. The cleanliness and
simplicity of the code, in practice, should also be compared. Such
a change may also improve the quality of the error messages.


\subsubsection{Performance Analysis of the Whole Program}

As described in \vref{sub:Methods-of-Analyzing}, performance analysis
was performed mostly on small components of a program. But since changes
in one part may affect another part, it will be useful to make comparisons
over an entire program for a given input in order to find out if a
certain algorithm is truly better or if it simply off-loads costs
elsewhere.


\subsubsection{Balancing for Complex Redox Reactions}

For some difficult redox reactions, the currently used algorithm will
produce a solution that satisfies the system of linear equations,
and therefore is balanced, but is not actually what occurs when the
reaction takes place.

This is because the system of linear equations has more than one solution,
and the solver always picks the simplest form.

To correctly handle these types of equations, it will be necessary
to find under what conditions this problem occurs. It will also be
necessary to determine how to distinguish between the various solutions
and determine the correct one.

It will perhaps be necessary to write a new algorithm for balancing,
based on oxidation numbers or perhaps on half-reactions.

This algorithm will not be necessary in all cases. It may be possible
to determine when to use this algorithm. Otherwise, a user-selected
option will be necessary (the ``Complex Redox'' tab).


\subsubsection{Messages and User Communications}

The messages in Chemlogic have been written to explain, primarily,
the specific syntax error a user is making and how the syntax error
relates to Chemistry. The messages have been reviewed and were simplified,
corrected or clarified according to advice.

The messages are written at a high-level, discuss the Chemistry in
abstract and often refer to the idea of unnecessary or incorrect characters.
Testing the error messages produced by the program with actual users
(Science students) will make the program more useful as a means of
reviewing Chemistry. It may be necessary, perhaps, to adjust the messages
to make them more clear, given what triggers them most, in practice.
Perhaps it would be useful to refer the user to sections from a textbook.

Improvements to the error handling functionality could allow for further
distinctions in the errors triggered, beyond error code and token
type. A particularly useful, but tedious, change would be to use templates
to insert specific information about the problem in a given input
(see Figure\vref{fig:error-improvements} for an example).

\section{\texttt{TODO} \label{sec:TODO}}


\subsection{Chemistry features}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Support for structural formulas: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  The covalent parser will have to be extended very much, to handle
structures of the compounds it supports 
\item  The formula parser will need to have some sort of input and output
representation for structural formulas
\item  Each output format will have its own ways of rendering structural
formulas. This will have to be extended.
\item A module will be needed to convert structural formulas to molecular
formulas for balancing and other processes.
\end{itemize}
\item  More organic naming: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  It will be useful to implement organic compound naming at least for
Chemistry 11 to 12.
\end{itemize}
\item  Complex Redox reactions: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  Sometimes, for a few very complex redox reactions, Chemlogic gives
an answer that satisfies the system of linear equations (i.e. is balanced)
but will not actually occur in real life. 
\item  A new balancing process, with a separate module should be implemented.
Perhaps based on oxidation numbers or half-reactions
\end{itemize}
\item  Diagramming: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  Show structural formulas of compounds 
\item  Bohr models, Lewis diagrams 
\item Periodic tables?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Program features}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Extend the \texttt{chemcli} DSL to make it more useful. 

\begin{itemize}
\item  Offer a way to query the chemical information database. 
\item  More constructs/operators.
\item  A standard library? 
\item  This will all depend on the sorts of programs that someone will actually
want to write
\end{itemize}
\item  Quiz program 

\begin{itemize}
\item Allow for questions to be generated with selectable options (the parser
and perhaps major sub-parts)
\item  Interactive and non-interactive usage depending on output format 
\item  Configurable marking (allow retry, show correct answer at end, etc.) 
\item  Possible to produce the same questions if passed the same seed.  Some
sort of intelligence, focusing on problem areas when giving questions.
\end{itemize}
\item  Expose the chemical information database.
\item  Better error messages for equation balancing errors 

\begin{itemize}
\item  Test to ensure that all elements appear in both products and reactants
\item  Perhaps explain why some charge shifts are unsatisfied 
\item  Explain which element makes the system unbalancable, if possible.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Organization and Structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Take advantage of SWI-Prolog's new string type. This makes tokenization,
concatenation and many other things more efficient. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Chemlogic needs a simple tokenizer to break up chemical names and
equations (especially) 
\item  At minimum, it should split on spaces and remove extraneous spaces 
\item  Potentially deal with character types? 
\item  Potentially deal with the insides of parentheses? 
\end{itemize}
\item  Rewrite the current error tokenizers to use the new and better functions 
\item  Tokenizers make parser much, much nicer: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  It is now quick and simple to see if something is an acid without
having to go through all of the tests 
\item  It can be easy to distinguish between ionic and covalent
\end{itemize}
\item  Make the oxyanion functions less messy and hacky. There must be a
better way to tell the user what's wrong with the oxyanion names. 
\item  The ugly hacks around pure substances can be removed with a better
tokenizer
\item  Some things will need to be renamed and reorganized
\item  Use more meta-programming to remove boilerplate code from the web
interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bugs}
\begin{itemize}
\item  The program will get very upset if a substance is repeated:

\begin{itemize}
\item  e.g. H2O + H2O --> H2O 
\item  There is not much of a valid reason to enter this, but the program
should handle this correctly 
\item  An error message explaining that this is junk is probably a good
idea\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
